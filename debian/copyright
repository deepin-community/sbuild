Upstream-Name: sbuild
Source: https://salsa.debian.org/debian/sbuild
Comment:
 sbuild is maintained by the Debian buildd-tools project team.  It was
 downloaded from https://salsa.debian.org/debian/sbuild.git.
 .
 The upstream source was originally downloaded from the CVS repository
   :pserver:anon@cvs.linux-m68k.org:/CVS (module: wanna-build)
 (up to version 0.36; September 2006), and the SVN repository
   http://svn.cyberhqz.com/svn/wanna-build
 (version 0.37; January 2006 to November 2006).  All future changes are
 in the buildd-tools GIT repository, with occasional merges from the
 upstream SVN repository.
 .
 Roman Hodek - wanna-build (and sbuild)
 Ben Collins - the "apt patch" for sbuild for finding source
 Ryan Murray - modifications for security building, maintenance
 Roger Leigh - schroot support and general maintenance
